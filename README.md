# Final Project
My final project idea is very personal for me. I would like to use this project as a way of finally giving my great grandfather the credit that he deserves. A German immigrant who was able to fully live his American dream, Maximilian Schneider was brought into the architectural firm Shreve and Lamb in order to help with the creation of the Empire State Building. Of course, he did not design the entire building all on his own, however, he is the sole creator of the huge, bronze plaque that hangs right in the lobby. And yet, his name is nowhere, he was unrecognized. A couple decades after his work on the Empire State building, Maximilian passed away of a heart attack in the middle of Grand Central Station during rush hour. Once again, he was unrecognized. 
While I don’t think fame or recognition was ever a goal of Maximilian’s, it feels very hard for me to just let his legacy slip away. This is why I would like my project to show the world the journey of Maximilian Schneider, and finally make it known that he built that beautiful plaque.
I will have revolving images with info about Maximilian around the empire state building, and in other drawings I will place the camera inside a floor of the building that will have photos of him and his work lining the walls. It will be a digital museum of the life of Maximilian Schneider.
